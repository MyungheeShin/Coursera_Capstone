< Developing model for effective implement of Disposal Cup Deposit system >

 Korean goverment is going to implement Disposal cup Deposit system in 2022. 
 Disposal cup Deposit system is that promotes the return of disposable cups discharged out of the store
 by charging a certain amount of disposable cups and refunding the cup amount when returning used cups.
 There is a law named 'ACT ON THE PROMOTION OF SAVING AND RECYCLING OF RESOURCES' about this system.
 But there is no specific implementation plan about the number of cafes which should be participated in this system.
 As you know, Environmental pollution is a very serious problem thesedays.
 We should try to recycle items, reduce the amount of trash.
 
 Therefore, I would like to analyze the data and recommand Policy suggestions about Disposal cup Deposit system.
 I will use the data about cafe sales figures, the number and location of cafes, the number and location of offices,
 the number and location of cultural facilities, the number and location of bus stops, the number and location of subway stations in seoul and so on.
 So, I try to find out the degree of necessity of Disposal cup Deposit system by region of seoul.
 And I will find out the number of cafes or unmanned recovery machine for this system by region in seoul Gangnamgu.
 With this calculating model, We can find out a useful information in other region in Korea.
 
 By this suggestion, I hope I can help preventing our environment effectively.
